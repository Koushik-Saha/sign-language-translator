#### Example Report Format

```
Subject: Security Vulnerability in Camera Access Module

Vulnerability Type: Authentication Bypass
Affected Component: Frontend camera access (src/components/CameraCapture.tsx)
Severity: High
Affected Versions: 1.2.0 - 1.4.2

Description:
An attacker can bypass camera permission checks by manipulating the 
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia() response, potentially gaining 
unauthorized access to camera feeds.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the camera setup page
2. When prompted for camera permission, click "Block"
3. Open browser developer tools
4. Execute the following code in console: [code snippet]
5. Camera access is granted despite user denial

Impact:
This could allow malicious websites to access user cameras without proper consent,
violating user privacy and potentially exposing sensitive information.

Suggested Fix:
Implement additional server-side validation of camera permission status
and add integrity checks for the media stream.
```
