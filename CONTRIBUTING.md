- `bug` - Bug fixes (often easier to start with)

## 💻 Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sign-language-translator.git
cd sign-language-translator

# Add the original repository as upstream

- Run tests: `npm test`

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/add-word-recognition
git checkout -b feature/improve-accuracy

# Bug fix branches
git checkout -b fix/camera-permission-issue
git checkout -b fix/translation-display-bug

# Documentation branches
git checkout -b docs/update-contributing-guide
git checkout -b docs/api-documentation

# Accessibility branches
git checkout -b a11y/keyboard-navigation
git checkout -b a11y/screen-reader-support
```

### Coding Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** configuration (automatic with our setup)
- Use **meaningful variable names** and functions
- Add **JSDoc comments** for functions and complex logic
- Prefer **functional programming** patterns when possible

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface GestureRecognitionResult {
  letter: string;
  confidence: number;
  landmarks: HandLandmark[];
}

const recognizeGesture = async (landmarks: HandLandmark[]): Promise<GestureRecognitionResult> => {
  // Implementation
};

// ❌ Avoid
const doStuff = (data: any) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

#### React Components
- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **single responsibility principle**
- Use **custom hooks** for reusable logic
- Implement **proper error boundaries**

```tsx
// ✅ Good component structure
interface CameraControlsProps {
  onStart: () => void;
  onStop: () => void;
  isActive: boolean;
}

export const CameraControls: React.FC<CameraControlsProps> = ({
  onStart,
  onStop,
  isActive
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      {/* Implementation */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### CSS/Styling
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Ensure **high contrast** for accessibility
- Use **semantic HTML** elements

```tsx
// ✅ Good styling approach
<button 
  className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 
             px-4 py-2 text-white rounded-md transition-colors
             disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
  aria-label="Start camera recognition"
>
  Start Recognition
</button>
```
